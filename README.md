***yt-dlp is a command-line program that lets you easily download videos and audio from more than a thousand websites. See the list of supported sites***

Note: yt-dlp is a fork of youtube-dl that was created after the parent project became stagnant. The upstream youtube-dl can still be installed as youtube-dlAUR; commands on this page should still work, but check the list of differences.

Installation
Install the yt-dlp package, or yt-dlp-gitAUR for the development version. It is recommended to also install FFmpeg as it is used for muxing for some sites.  

There are also various graphical frontends to yt-dlp, such as parabolicAUR, tartubeAUR and yt-dlg-gitAUR. You can also install yt-dlp-drop-inAUR which provides a fake /usr/bin/youtube-dl executable (that just redirects to yt-dlp) for outdated programs that still look for a youtube-dl executable.
